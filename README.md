# student-dropout-prediction
Student dropout classification prediction, using several algorithms, such as Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree, and XGBoost Classifier. Dataset from Kaggle.
Highest accuracy I got was 73% from decision tree bagging. I wanted to keep going, find better parameters and maybe perform more feature selection, but my computer is pretty old, slow, with an old CPU that only has 4 cores. It would've taken days to get something above 80%, and I don't really have that kind of time to spare for one project (I'm a student).
