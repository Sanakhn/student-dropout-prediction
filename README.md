# student-dropout-prediction
Student dropout classification prediction, using several algorithms, such as Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree, and XGBoost Classifier. Dataset from Kaggle.
Highest accuracy I got was 73% from decision tree bagging. I wanted to keep going, find better parameters and maybe perform more feature selection, but my computer is pretty old and slow, and that would've taken a considerable amount of time (which I don't have).
