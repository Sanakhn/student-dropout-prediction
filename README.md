# Student Dropout Prediction
## Overview
This project aims to predict student dropout rates based on a variety of factors such as demographics, academic performance, and behavior. 
Using machine learning algorithms, I built a binary classification model to predict whether a student is likely to drop out of school. 
The dataset used is publicly available, and I performed extensive data cleaning, analysis, and feature engineering to ensure the quality of the input data.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn
- Machine Learning Algorithms: Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree, and XGBoost Classifier
- Jupyter Notebook (for data analysis and model building)

## Dataset

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy. Here are the results for different algorithms used in the project:
Random Forest: Accuracy = 74%
Decision Tree: Accuracy = 73%
XGBoost Classifier: Accuracy = 72%

## Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning for improved model performance.
- Experiment with additional features and more complex models.
- Deploy the model for real-time predictions on new student data.
